<p>WebSocket Traffic Monitor &amp; Exporter is a comprehensive extension for real-time monitoring, capturing, and
    exporting WebSocket traffic across all Burp tools. It provides tool source
    tracking, numbered connection organization, and CSV export capabilities through a user-friendly
    interface.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Real-time WebSocket Monitoring</strong>:
        Captures WebSocket messages from all Burp tools including Proxy, Repeater, Scanner, and Intruder. Displays
        incoming
        and outgoing messages in real-time with support for both text and binary message types. Features intelligent
        capture
        control with enable/disable toggle functionality.</li>

    <li><strong>Message Management</strong>:
        Tracks which Burp tool each WebSocket originated from and assigns unique IDs to each connection for easy
        identification. Only displays WebSockets that have actually received messages and provides context menu
        integration
        for sending historical messages to the monitoring tab.</li>

    <li><strong>User-Friendly Interface</strong>:
        Split-pane layout with message table on the left and payload viewer on the right. Scrollable dropdown organized
        by
        newest connections first with responsive real-time updates. Click any message row to view the full payload
        content.
    </li>

    <li><strong>CSV Export</strong>:
        Auto-suggests filenames in <code class="InlineCode">ID-URL-TOOL.csv</code> format with complete message data
        including direction, content, binary status, length, and Burp-consistent timestamps.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<h3>Basic Monitoring</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to the "WebSocket Messages" tab</li>
    <li>Ensure "Enable Message Capture" is checked</li>
    <li>Use any Burp tool to interact with WebSocket endpoints</li>
    <li>Messages appear automatically in the table as they flow</li>
</ol>

<h3>Message Export</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Select a WebSocket from the dropdown menu</li>
    <li>Click "Export to CSV" button</li>
    <li>Choose destination folder in the file dialog</li>
    <li>Enter filename (defaults to <code class="InlineCode">ID-URL-TOOL.csv</code> format)</li>
    <li>CSV includes direction, message content, binary flag, length, and timestamp</li>
</ol>

<h3>Capture Control</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Toggle message capture on/off without losing existing data.</li>
    <li>WebSockets opened while capture is disabled are tracked
        in the background but not displayed.</li>
    <li>Re-enabling capture shows new traffic from previously opened connections,
        providing flexible monitoring control.</li>
</ul>
